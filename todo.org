#+TITLE: Todo

* Do it now
** TODO cdlatex accents
And use the accent engine to make the ~abar -> \bar{a}~ style snippets.
** TODO Try to find how to generate undo entries
So users can easily undo expansions. Maybe even bind DEL in a transient map
after expansions to undo expansions.
** TODO Org table <-> elisp code pipeline
The table -> code is preferable I think
*** TODO Figure what to
** TODO Yasnippet expansions
Store the snippets source in a list/hashmap instead of separate files.
*** TODO Smart frac
** DONE Finer grained subscripts
So a_11 becomes a_{11} - essentially you'd write a11 to get the subscripts.

* In consideration
** Stricter condition for some cases?
Sometimes ~texmathp~ isn't enough. Too many words contain the letters "to" to have
it expand to ~\to~ unconditionally in maths.
** Snippets for envs?
I'm not sure how much better we can do in this case compared to just yasnippet.
** Separating the engine from snippets
The Yasnippet route
